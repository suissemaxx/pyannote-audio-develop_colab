    """Voice activity detection

    Voice activity detection (or VAD) is the task of detecting speech regions
    in a given audio recording.

    It is addressed as a binary (0 or 1) sequence labeling task. A frame is
    marked as "speech" (1) as soon as at least one speaker is active.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration. Defaults to 2s.
    warm_up : float or (float, float), optional
        Use that many seconds on the left- and rightmost parts of each chunk
        to warm up the model. While the model does process those left- and right-most
        parts, only the remaining central part of each chunk is used for computing the
        loss during training, and for aggregating scores during inference.
        Defaults to 0. (i.e. no warm-up).
    balance: str, optional
        When provided, training samples are sampled uniformly with respect to that key.
        For instance, setting `balance` to "uri" will make sure that each file will be
        equally represented in the training samples.
    weight: str, optional
        When provided, use this key to as frame-wise weight in loss function.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch. Defaults to 32.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
        Defaults to multiprocessing.cpu_count() // 2.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
    augmentation : BaseWaveformTransform, optional
        torch_audiomentations waveform transform, used by dataloader
        during training.
