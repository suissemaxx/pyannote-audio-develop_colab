class Task(pl.LightningDataModule):
    """Base task class

    A task is the combination of a "problem" and a "dataset".
    For example, here are a few tasks:
    - voice activity detection on the AMI corpus
    - speaker embedding on the VoxCeleb corpus
    - end-to-end speaker diarization on the VoxConverse corpus

    A task is expected to be solved by a "model" that takes an
    audio chunk as input and returns the solution. Hence, the
    task is in charge of generating (input, expected_output)
    samples used for training the model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    protocol : Protocol
        pyannote.database protocol
    duration : float, optional
        Chunks duration in seconds. Defaults to two seconds (2.).
    min_duration : float, optional
        Sample training chunks duration uniformely between `min_duration`
        and `duration`. Defaults to `duration` (i.e. fixed length chunks).
    warm_up : float or (float, float), optional
        Use that many seconds on the left- and rightmost parts of each chunk
        to warm up the model. This is mostly useful for segmentation tasks.
        While the model does process those left- and right-most parts, only
        the remaining central part of each chunk is used for computing the
        loss during training, and for aggregating scores during inference.
        Defaults to 0. (i.e. no warm-up).
    batch_size : int, optional
        Number of training samples per batch. Defaults to 32.
    num_workers : int, optional
        Number of workers used for generating training samples.
        Defaults to multiprocessing.cpu_count() // 2.
    pin_memory : bool, optional
        If True, data loaders will copy tensors into CUDA pinned
        memory before returning them. See pytorch documentation
        for more details. Defaults to False.
    augmentation : BaseWaveformTransform, optional
        torch_audiomentations waveform transform, used by dataloader
        during training.

    Attributes
    ----------
    specifications : Specifications or dict of Specifications
        Task specifications (available after `Task.setup` has been called.)
